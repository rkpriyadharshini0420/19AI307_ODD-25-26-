# Ex.No:1(A) INTRODUCTION TO JAVA PROGRAMMING, DATA TYPES, VARIABLES AND OPERATORS

## QUESTION:
Lovely has just started learning Java and is very excited about how to display messages on the screen. Her first mission is to understand how different types of print statements work:

System.out.print() → prints on the same line


System.out.println() → prints and moves to the next line

System.out.printf() → prints formatted output


## AIM:
To write a Java program that demonstrates the use of variables, data types, operators, and different print statements (print, println, and printf).

## ALGORITHM :
1.	Start the program.
2.	Import the required package java.util.* (optional).
3.	Declare variables of different data types (int, float, char, String).
4.	Perform simple arithmetic operations using operators.
5.	Use System.out.print() to display output on the same line.
6.	Use System.out.println() to display output on the next line.
7.	Use System.out.printf() to print formatted output.
8.	End the program.

## PROGRAM:
 ```
/*
Program to implement variables and Operators using Java
Developed by: PRIYADHARSHINI R K
Register Number:212223040155
*/
```

## Sourcecode.java:
```
import java.util.*;
public class Main
{
    public static void main(String args[])
    {
        Scanner sc=new Scanner(System.in);
        String name=sc.next();
        int age=sc.nextInt();
        double num=sc.nextDouble();
        System.out.println("Hello, "+name);
        System.out.println("You are "+age+" years old");
        System.out.printf("Your favorite number is %.2f ",num);
    }
}
```

# Ex.No:1(B) CONDITIONAL STATEMENT

## QUESTION:
In a haunted house, lights turn on or off based on the hour of entry:

If the hour is even and between 2 and 6 (inclusive), lights flicker.

If the hour is odd and between 7 and 11, lights stay off.

If the hour is 12, lights turn red.

Otherwise, the house is dark.


## AIM:
To write a Java program that uses conditional statements to determine the state of lights in a haunted house based on the hour of entry.

## ALGORITHM :
1. Start the program.

2. Import the necessary package java.util.*.

3. Create a Scanner object to read the hour input from the user.

4. Read the hour as an integer.

5. Check if the hour is even and between 2 and 6 (inclusive):

6. Display “Lights flicker”.

7. Else if the hour is odd and between 7 and 11:

8. Display “Lights stay off”.

9. Else if the hour is 12:

10. Display “Lights turn red”.
 
11. Display “The house is dark”.

12. End the program.

            System.out.println("Lights flicker");
        } else if (a>= 7 && a <= 11 && a % 2 != 0) {
            System.out.println("Lights off");
        } else if (a == 12) {
            System.out.println("Lights red");
        } else {
            System.out.println("Dark house");
        }
    }
}

## ALGORITHM :
1.	Start the program.

2.	Import the necessary package 'java.util'

3. Read the number of rows from the user.
